* Approaches
** XGBoost

** Random Forests
*** http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/ensemble.html
* Tools
** TPOT pipeline optimization
https://github.com/rhiever/tpot
A good tool to find the best hyperparameters to maximise performance for a model
** Cookiecutter Kaggle template
https://github.com/uberwach/cookiecutter-kaggle
Cookiecutter is a tool that creates python project setups based on a template, this is one for kaggle competitions, might be useful

Good talk on Kaggle competitions generally, what tends to win. A bit dated now, still worth looking at random forests and gradient boosted forests as naive approaches to projects
